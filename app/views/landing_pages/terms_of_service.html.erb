NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION (ORAL OR WRITTEN) OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BAKECYCLE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.
    </p>

    <p>
      USE OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. BAKECYCLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AT THE TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING; THAT THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE FREE OF INACCURACIES, MISREPRESENTATIONS BY USERS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
    </p>

    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BAKECYCLE, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “RELATED PARTIES”) BE LIABLE TO YOU BASED ON OR RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, EVEN IF BAKECYCLE AND/OR RELATED PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a court shall find that the above disclaimers are not enforceable, then you agree that neither BakeCycle nor any of its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, employees, members, shareholders, or directors shall be liable for (1) any damages in excess of $500.00 or (2) any indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages or loss of use, lost revenue, lost profits or data to you or any third party from your use of the Products or Services. This limitation shall apply regardless of the basis of your claim or whether or not the limited remedies provided herein fail of their essential purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to defend, indemnify and hold BakeCycle and its suppliers, subsidiaries, licensors, and licensees, and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, members, employees and agents harmless from all allegations, judgments, awards, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, and costs of litigation arising out of or based on (a) Submissions or Content you submit, post to or transmit through the Products or Services (b) your use of the Products or Services, (c) your violation of the Agreement, and (d) any conduct, activity or action which is unlawful or illegal under any state, federal or common law, or is violative of the rights of any individual or entity, engaged in, caused by, or facilitated in any way through the use of Products or Services.
    </p>

    <h2>DISPUTES, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
    <p>
      You agree that any claim or dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Products or Services or any service provided by BakeCycle, will be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The laws of the State of New York shall govern this Agreement, and shall be used in any arbitration proceeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the following address: 64 Allen St, 5th Floor, New York NY 10002.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arbitration under this Agreement will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules then in effect. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      You and BakeCycle agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, both you and BakeCycle agree that parties have each waived any right to a jury trial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that BakeCycle may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property or other proprietary rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the extent arbitrations does not apply, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to the Services, or to BakeCycle, may only be brought by you in a state or federal court located in New York, New York. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS VENUE AS INCONVENIENT OR INAPPROPRIATE, AND AGREE TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN NEW YORK.
    </p>

    <h2>POLICIES FOR CHILDREN</h2>
    <p>
      The Products and Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, nor do they contain information which would be potentially harmful to minors. In the event that BakeCycle discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, we will make efforts to delete the child’s information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Please see the Federal Trade Commission’s Products for (www.ftc.gov) for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230 (d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. More information on the availability of such software can be found through publicly available sources. You may wish to contact your internet service provider for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>GENERAL</h2>
    <p>
      Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found for any reason to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be given its maximum enforceable effect, or shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Revisions. This Agreement may only be revised in a writing signed by BakeCycle. In the event that BakeCycle updates this Agreement and you are made aware of the update, your continued use of the Products or Services after the update shall constitute an agreement to the updated terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and BakeCycle as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Products or Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assignment. BakeCycle may assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the Agreement without BakeCycle’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.
    </p>

    <p>
      No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equitable Remedies. You hereby agree that BakeCycle would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between you and BakeCycle with respect to the Products and Services, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether electronic, oral or written.
